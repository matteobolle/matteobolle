# 👋 Yo! I'm Matthew aka [@matteobolle](https://github.com/matteobolle) 🎉
I am 15 (still 15 (still 15 (still 15 (still 15 (still 15 (still 15 (still 15 (still <AGE_PLACEHOLDER>)))))))) years old.

Welcome to my GitHub cave! Here, I mess around with tech stuff, like writing code that never works on the first try. Here’s some pointless info about me (you’re probably not gonna read it all, but whatever):

## 🚀 Stuff I do... maybe
- **I write code** (sometimes it even works): things like Python, JS, and other languages I barely understand myself.
- **Cloud and other nerdy stuff:** yeah, I love making VMs on DigitalOcean and Linode. Don’t ask me about my bill though.
- **Open Source?!:** Mostly just watch other people do the real work.

## 🖥️ My super tech powers
- **Languages:** Python (🐍 no, not the snake. terrible joke, dont cancel me pls), JavaScript (I forget the brackets half the time), HTML (for making sites no one visits), CSS (for trying to make them pretty, but failing).
- **Complicated things:** long a** message.
- **Toolz:** long a** message.
- **Cloud stuff:** DigitalOcean, Linode, CloudFlare, and Vercel.

## 😾 Furry 
Yep, I’m a furry. Don’t ask why, I just am. 😾🎨
